# Band-Gap-Prediction-via-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this notebook I worked in my final project for the Machine Learning subject in the Postgraduate Program in Computer Science at CICESE reproducing interisting research about the prediction of band gap for 2D materials via ML techniques. This was very interisting because these approaches depend on first principles calculations .
